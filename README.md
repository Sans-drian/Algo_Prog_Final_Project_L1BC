The repository for my Final Project: A Simple Pixel Art Maker Program.

To be able to run the code, please download the 'fpScriptmain' file and the 'utils' folder. Do not download the files in the folder individually, just download the whole folder.
The program demo video is uploaded here. It is 2 minutes and 57 seconds long and the file is 58.1 MB large.

**More details will be in the Project Report.** *(As of 3:33AM, it is still being written, but by the morning-noon, it will be finished.*
