# Algo_Prog_Final_Project_L1BC

The repository for my Final Project: A Simple Pixel Art Maker Program.

To be able to run the code, please download the 'fpScriptmain' file and the 'utils' folder. Do not download the files in the folder individually, just download the whole folder.

The program demo video is uploaded here, it is 2 minutes and 57 seconds long and the file size is 58.1 MB.

Some detail: This whole project was done by following this tutorial on youtube: https://youtu.be/N20eXcfyQ_4. I want to give credit now since my Project Report is not done yet.

**More details will be in the Project Report.**
